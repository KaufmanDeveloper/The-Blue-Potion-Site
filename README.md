# The Blue Potion website by Michael Kaufman
Example website built to display web development skills

Uses simple PHP and MySQL interactions to display comments on the main page

In the WordPress folder, the total theme in wp-content was edited by me and serves as the WordPress version of the homepage of the site, and was used to practice WordPress skills.
